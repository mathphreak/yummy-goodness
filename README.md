# Yummy Goodness
CS:GO's ingame economy system extracted into its own game for [@eevee's GAMES MADE QUICK???](https://itch.io/jam/games-made-quick)

## but why?
Game jams are cool and I want to participate in more of them.

I'm not very good at the economy side of CS:GO so I wanted to get better.

I've been wanting to learn Elm for a while now and I thought this was as good a time as any.

## okay but seriously why did you call it that
It's a reference to [this tutorial thing](https://youtu.be/DpXtRbggpQM?t=4m40s).

## FEATURES

- Players have proper inventory (UI: ‚òπÔ∏è)
- Players are on teams (UI: üòê)
- Buy things with the actual CS:GO buy menu (UI: üôÇ)
    - Deemphasize submenu if nothing inside is affordable
- Buy things for each player (UI: ‚òπÔ∏è)
- Make players drop weapons (UI: ‚òπÔ∏è)
- Simulate rounds of game (UI: ‚òπÔ∏è)
    - In each matchup, one player dies and one player gets $3000
    - This happens five times per round but skips if one player is dead

## TODO

- Make enemies buy things too
- Explain some things
- Difficulty settings
    - Don't show enemy equipment
    - Time limit for purchases
    - Players don't always do what you say
- Simulate rounds of game
    - Round win/loss exists
    - Weapon kill rewards are a thing
    - Weapon damage exists
    - Armor is a thing
    - Matchups are better
    - Switch sides at halftime
    - Pick up enemy weapons sometimes
- Appease the gods of line length and dead code
